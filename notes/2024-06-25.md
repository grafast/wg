## 3. Status Update (Benjie) 

Since the last working group in September 2023, global dependices and early exit have both been addressed. 

**Global dependencies**  
[See last WG for an overview of the problem](https://github.com/grafast/wg/blob/68ae0d3f2d363a8949d2d1b63a4650ecc1077297/notes/2023-10-24.md#4-global-dependencies-proposal-benjie)  
The solution has been reached: "unary" values  
If Gra*fast* knows there will always be _exactly one value for a step_, then that step will be a "unary" step. 
Arguments, variables, and context are always unary. 

**Early exit**  
[See last WG for an overview of the problem](https://github.com/grafast/wg/blob/68ae0d3f2d363a8949d2d1b63a4650ecc1077297/notes/2023-10-24.md#5-early-exit-proposal-benjie)    
The solution is a new step: `inhibitOnNull()`  
`$a = inhibitOnNull($b)`: if `$b` is null then anything that depends on `$a` will automatically be null (and won't be evaluated).  
`assertNotNull($b)`: raises an exception if `$b` is null (thereby preventing future steps executing).  
`$b = trap($a, TRAP_INHIBITED, { valueForInhibited: "EMPTY_LIST" })` copies `$a` unless it's inhibited, in which case it becomes `[]`.  
This could also, in theory, trap errors - though there is a bug in this at the moment. Internally, we re-wrote how errors and nulls are handled - we now
use bit masks to flag the values in the system to flag if they are an error, null, inhibited or not.  
By default, nulls are accepted but errors and inhibited values are not; Trap can be configured to accept the different flags.
